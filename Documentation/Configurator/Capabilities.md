# Capabilities

A game Owner or Admin may wish to set specific read / write permissions for particular areas of the Portal. You may want a user of your game to make changes to Events and Leaderboards, but only view the configuration of Virtual Goods and Achievements, whilst be prevented from viewing or editing the Integrations and Downloadables sections.  

We allow a highly configurable set of capabilities throughout the entire platform including a more finer granularity of permissions to be set in the Manage section for Screens and Snippets.

### Collaborators

You may already be familiar with the use of Collaborators on a game. Previously, when configuring Collaborators on a game within Portal, we had just 2 types of permissions available - an Administrator and a Read-Only user, which we refer to as *gameAdmin* and *readOnly* permissions respectively. These were not configurable to the finer granularity that we allow today. However, we highly recommend that the permissions on these "default" Groups (which can now be found in *Groups*) should not be modified as their visibility should serve only as an intuitive template on how to configure your own types of permissive Groups going forward.

By default on any game, the *gameAdmin* and *readOnly* Groups will be displayed. The game author and owner will always have full read / write access to everything in the Portal, regardless of how the settings are changed for other game Admins. As mentioned earlier, the game Admin users and read-only users permissions can be altered by modifying the gameAdmin and readOnly Groups respectively. However, as good practice, we want to create our own custom Groups that give us finer permissive control over the accessibility of the game.

*1.* To create a new Group, navigate to the *Overview* page and click the add '*+*' button in the *Groups* tab under *Collaborators*.

*2.* Provide a name and description for the Group and enable Read and Write permissions for each capability in the Portal as desired.

*3.* Save the Group. It will then be displayed in the list of Groups.

*4.* Select the Collaborators tab and add a new Collaborator.

*5.* Assign a user to the new Group by selecting the newly created Group in the dropdown menu and save the changes.

*6.* Login as the Collaborator and navigate to the game. Immediately, it is noticeable that not all the options available to a game Admin are available on the screen for this Group.

Based on the Capabilities set, they may be able to view certain things but not edit them. For example, in my configuration of Capabilities, the* Messages* Capability only has read permissions. This means I can navigate to the Messages section, but when I try to edit any Message, I will see the following:

Based on my configuration, this is the same for Teams, Virtual Goods, Achievements and Challenges. For those Capabilities that have neither read or write permissions, they won't be visible.

### Screens and Snippets

As mentioned earlier, we can add finer permissive controls to what users can see and do with Screens and Snippets. For example, access can be given to the Screen and the corresponding Snippets with the exception of the *player_virtual_good* and *player_currencies* Snippets for the newly created Group. Therefore, when a user is logged in with only that Group, they can see the Players Screen as normal, except the information displayed for Virtual Goods and Currencies.

**NOTE: By default, all Screens and Snippets have Nothing Selected for Groups. Unless specific Groups are selected for Screens and Snippets, everyone will be able to view them.**

*7.* As the game Admin, go to the *Manage* section and Edit the *Players* Screen. Select the newly created Group in the *Groups* dropdown as well as for the *gameAdmin* Group so that Admins can also view it.

*8.* Do the same for each corresponding Snippet. Add both the newly created Group and the default *gameAdmin* group.

![](img/Capabilities/9.png)

*9.* For Snippets *player_virtual_goods* *and* *player_currencies*, select only the *gameAdmin* Group.

![](img/Capabilities/10.png)

*10.* Login as the user belonging to the newly created Group. Load the *Players* Screen and you can see that the *player_virtual_goods and player_currencies* Snippets cannot be viewed.
