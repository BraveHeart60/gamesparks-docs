# Virtual Goods

In the context of the GameSparks platform, a Virtual Good is any in-game asset that can be awarded, accumulated, or bought. This would cover XP points and in-game currencies as well as specific goods that deliver benefits in-game (convenience, customization, competitive advantage, and so on).  These can be used and consumed cross-platform. You can set up Virtual Goods to be bought as IAPs - you associate the Virtual Goods with the Product IDs of the corresponding items on the stores and when a good is purchased, the store receipts are reconciled with the items.  You can also establish relationships between them so they can be traded or converted.

## Managing Virtual Goods Configurations

The Configurator Virtual Goods page displays the list of Virtual Goods and allows you to create new Virtual Goods and edit or delete existing ones.

  * *Short Code* \- The Short Code is a mandatory field used to give the Virtual Good a unique identifier for use elsewhere in the Portal and in Cloud Code.

  * *Currencies* \- The amount of each currency needed to buy the Virtual Good.
  * *Product IDs* \- The ID of the item that has been created in the appropriate store.
  * *Max Quantity* \- The maximum quantity of this good that the player can own at any one time. Only enforced on [BuyVirtualGoodsRequest](/API Documentation/Request API/Store/BuyVirtualGoodsRequest.md) using virtual currency. Purchases from external stores will still be awarded even if they result in this maximum being exceeded.
  * *Tags* \- Tags associated with the Virtual Good.
  * *Type* \- Specify the type: Is this a Virtual Good or a Currency Pack?
    * You would typically select Currency Pack as the Virtual Goods type when you want to award a Currency Pack as a reward for an achievement in a game. Any player awarded the Currency Pack will then be *granted* each of the currency amounts entered for the Currency 1-6 fields.
