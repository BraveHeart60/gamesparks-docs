# Analytics, Segmentation and Game Management

Learn how to build and maintain highly customised reporting and management dashboards and screens:
* Exploit the versatility of Dynamic Forms for [Custom Analytic Dashboards](/Tutorials/Analytics, Segmentation and Game Management/Custom Analytics Dashboards.md).
* Customise and deploy [pre-built screens](/Tutorials/Analytics, Segmentation and Game Management/Player Profile Screen.md) for leaderboards, player screens and more.
* Use GameSparks [Properties](/Tutorials/Analytics, Segmentation and Game Management/Segmented Properties.md) to deploy custom JSON configuration against objectsâ€”introduce Segments to apply different values to Properties and achieve another level of customisation.
