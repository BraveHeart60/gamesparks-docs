# Matches

Matchmaking allows Players to be matched in real-time based on common attributes they share within a game. Using entirely customised threshold criteria and time-based rounds of matching, Players can be strictly or loosely matched with an unlimited level of precision.

## Managing Matches

The Multiplayer page in the Configurator section of the Portal, displays the list of Matches and allows you to create new Matches and edit or delete existing ones.
