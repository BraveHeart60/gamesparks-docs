# Hearthstone style card game example

This series of tutorials will show an example of how to achieve a Hearthstone style card game on the GameSparks platform using already existing components and combining them to produce a fully functioning game on the cloud. We will be using the NoSQL database, matches, challenges, cloud code, events, modules and the test harness to ensure the game is developed and functions the way we want it to.

You will be creating a card game where each card represents a pre-defined type of card with attack, hitpoints, tier and effect stats. Two players are pitted against each other and use the cards to lower eachother's health to 0. First player to reach 0 loses.

The first tutorial will be the [initilisation and ranking system](..\Multiplayer\HearthstoneInitRank.html).

the second tutorial will be the [matchmaking](..\Multiplayer\HearthstoneMatchmaking.html).

And finally the third tutorial will be the [challenge](..\Multiplayer\HearthstoneChallenge.html) itself.

After finishing this series of tutorials you should be a lot more comfortable creating games on our platform and it will give you a chance to work on framework to experiment with.
