This is part 4 of a 6 part tutorial, it's recommended that you look at the previous section before continuing. The exercises in this section take place exclusively in the GameSparks portal. You will set up a leaderboard and create an event to post scores to that leaderboard. Then you’ll use the GameSparks Test Harness to make sure everything works.

###  Setting Up a new Event and Leaderboard

** 1) Create a Post Score Event** Open up portal.gamesparks.net and navigate to Configurator>Overview. To create a new event, click on the small plus icon. This will open the Create Event dialogue. ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dZtZGcX6SjXqM9PcZQ-H-3AUP9hPGZ4y4Q8HtILzqGoEs9KB2tVa8O7_xD1PFz0G5DbNLrDuJ9LSLr3IjYQelziISLgGax2mCIvYQxAKXxJHpbJrBGUy8Cvqf7N3bXB-gA) **2) Enter Event details** Fill in the details of the event. For this exercise name the event “Post Score” and fill in the description as “it posts the score”. Fill in the short code as “postScore”. The short code is the reference we will use in our Unity scripts to post scores to GameSparks. In practice these fields can contain whatever you like. The name and description are human readable and the Short Code is code readable and will call or register the event. ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Jn_eQtpS7934b2344ZvntKBja_hYNlY-sWXjJ3QEr8ZWWp07F-sCzpxoLZYCf-fIOIutNV2TUOWljubxzFdNWTLsIR6AGYtydF10pu5obfR7AuOVVFY6dg9uBUDCm5VOow) Next is to add the event’s attributes. Press the plus icon in the Create Event dialogue. This is what information will be returned and stored in GameSparks when the event is triggered in game. This event should return the highest score the player achieved so set the Data Type to “Number” and the Default Calc to “Maximum”. The name should be a new name for the attribute, in this case call it “Score”. The short code will be “score”. Hit save to save the event. ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bwfMghNQ1z53bCX39V9c_TyxqVruYCp1qO2T63-emtdqefZHHkgRuP46qgBxv1T0DSt4l2YzaRfo7zqTQ1mVZZhkA2cEdUez-2GS-cOGDcg4HE5QRn4fbOiv8pvZaYJazg) **3) Create a Leaderboard** Open up the Leaderboard menu by navigating to Configurator>Leaderboards. Here you can create and manage your leaderboards. Click the plus icon to bring up the Create Leaderboard dialogue. For this exercise fill in the name as “High Score Leaderboard”, the description as “it’s a leaderboard” and the short code as “highScoreLeaderboard”. The Update schedule can be set to reset the leaderboard daily, weekly or monthly if you want to create time-limited leaderboards. This leaderboard will be a continuous global ranking of the top scores, so leave the Update Schedule  as “Real-time”.The High Score and Social notifications can be left on on for the time being. These will send a push notification to your player if someone beats their highscore. Press the plus icon to add fields to this leaderboard. The event and event attribute you set earlier is already filled in, if not make sure that Running Total is set to you “Post Score” event and that the Summary is set to “Score”. Leave the filter type at * and the value blank. Sort Order should be set to “Desc”. ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/D6wLRqJmBBaVcEjL4kEQw97yuC4WUOwPpFDxRnnRJAId0hEhGcbqHmITibwsDgy0k-A-Q8VOCGS_cVNOAIgh0CAlzhymWt8KtUcYq5OGYZfqxsU2iI93zY8coGNAAaLdzQ) And that’s it. You have successfully set up a basic score leaderboard. Next thing to do is use the GameSparks Test Harness to make sure it’s working properly.

### Testing in the GameSparks Test harness

**1) Authenticating** The GameSparks test harness lets you test all the GameSparks functionality you have set up before writing a line of code in your game. To test your new Leaderboard and Event on the Test Harness you first have to Authenticate as a user to send events. Open up the Test Harness in the Gamesparks Portal. Since this project is using Facebook to authenticate its users we will authenticate with FacebookConnectRequest. Click FacebookConnectRequest under the Authentication tab in the Requests window. ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PIbURkPMEdNQD7aY8C3yusoourcmA4yCGnpn9RK_H855rqhWJv6R0OMBq59B3q8Ptexg-YKZeQpp2PydboI20la2BsuFA3DGVFjxND2sE12DASO3CuQJ80xsj6X27sLNVA) Retrieve your access token from the developer.facebook.app page (Tools>Access Token) and copy this. Return to the GameSparks Test Harness and paste the Access Token in the JSON window under the “accessToken” field highlighted above. It should look like this: ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/uc1EEjcpY5QML6SdGN11jRDLX36xuyv4bvBiDmnUKrPpvS3MW-7ILgQ7LOnMCFIzGr1IzoP8vaehb9PcM1f9WS-P6032kNfJ9CYqJ6-j1fwilbRxjRZibNIQxaPQXKM_AA) Click the send button highlighted above. In the inspector on the right you can see the request you sent in green text and the response in blue text. You should see your name returned and an Authentication Token filled in automatically. ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MYtlFb0eFHZRO1xjP0LoqY0trndcTEXxxWr0TxVI6NIjhpBTPZ70xtAsjnbaxJ3IPTcp80amY0GdZXCcLq-tsNvf0fxobYpoHcs7urkIGjo0O9siFg2vZN3lG-vZ46tJhw)

**2) Log an Event in the Test Harness**

Click the LogEvent tab in the Requests menu. You will see the Post Score event that you set up earlier in the exercise. Click it and the text in the JSON box will change. You will see a “score” key - this is the score attribute you defined earlier. Change the value of score to any numerical value, 15 for now. Send the request.
