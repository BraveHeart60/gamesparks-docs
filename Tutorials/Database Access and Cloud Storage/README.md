# Database Access and Cloud Storage

Here are some tutorials that will help you to perform common tasks involving database access and cloud storage:
* To process your queries more efficiently, you can [create indices](/Tutorials/Database Access and Cloud Storage/Creating Game Collection Indices.md) for your custom data collections.
* No matter how big your data collections, you can use some handy tools for [searching for players and teams](/Tutorials/Database Access and Cloud Storage/Searching for PLayers and Teams.md).
* If you have a complex JSON document stored, you can build [partial queries or updates](/Tutorials/Database Access and Cloud Storage/Submitting JSON Document Queries.md) for specific sections of the document.
