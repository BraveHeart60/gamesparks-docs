# Game Engines Analysis and Comparison

Intro  

### **Unreal Engine 4**

  _"Unreal Engine 4 is a complete suite of game development tools made by game developers, for game developers. From 2D mobile games to console blockbusters and VR, Unreal Engine 4 gives you everything you need to start, ship, grow and stand out from the crowd."_ Unreal Engine 4 is the successor to Unreal Engine 3 which was a hugely influential engine capable of providing tools to suit the development for any game. UE4 brings a lot of extra power to the already robust arsenal of tools and conveniences which super charge the engine and extinguish it as one of the best while already being a complete tool for 3D and 2D development across many platforms including Windows, Mac, Xbox, Playstation, Android and Browser. The powerful Blueprint visual programming language is one of said additions which allows developers to quickly prototype anything that comes to mind and extends from Gameplay programming to networking programming making it very easy and convenient to use allowing even beginners to achieve great results and complete games. UE4 also gives you access to the engine's source code and the ability to further expand the limitations of Blueprint by allowing the developer to create Blueprint libraries through C++ programming that suit the need of development and open more doors for the designers and artists that aren't comfortable with C++ programming but need the functionality only accessible by the low level language. Projects can be developed exclusively on Blueprint or C++ or a combination of both. UE4 community comes alive in its market, where any developer can access a Google play/Apple App Market-esque store which includes whole projects, games, levels, Blueprints, art assets, music, audio, tools and plugins developed by the community. Developers can add each other as 'friends' and contact each other real time using instant messaging provided by Epic. Plugins are a huge convenience. Where UE4 lacks, the community makes up in, there are Plugins for everything and the community is always active and supportive. A simple post to the fourms about a certain tool or convenience needed could end up inspiring a very useful plugin. Plugins are ,as the name suggests, plug and play tools which work with the engine to provide extra functionality that epic doesn't offer or work to improve already existing tools. Impressive lighting, ease of use, ability to bring any design to life in little time, Blueprint programming and having everything in one place makes UE4 a powerhouse to rapidly develop incredible looking worlds and populate them with particles, AI, mechanics and UI with little effort and headache. Epic has done intensive work to make sure their Engine is easy to use and has released an abundance of tutorials, guides and demos to help bring beginners to an intermediate level in record timing. Epic's forums and answer hub are always active and have a very good community. There is usually already an answer to the questions you have somewhere, which always helps in development as you do not want to end up with a dead end especially since UE4 is still in development and isn't the finished product. Currently Unreal Engine 4 is free to use and develop on. However if you earn more than $3000 from your project, you will have to pay 5% royalties to Epic.

### **Unity**

  _"Unity is a flexible and powerful development platform for creating multiplatform 3D and 2D games and interactive experiences. It's a complete ecosystem for anyone who aims to build a business on creating high-end content and connecting to their most loyal and enthusiastic players and customers."_ Unity engine enjoys a very huge loyal following by independent developers and recently increasing use by already established studios and all for the right reasons. Unity simplifies games development and makes everything easy to use and easy to find all in one place which speeds up the process of development and makes prototyping an enjoyable and stress free experience. Studios can bring a number of designs to life quickly to assess and evaluate them and to determine what to keep and what to leave behind.  Unity caters for both 2D and 3D development across many platforms and keeps the development pipeline similar no matter what the game is developed for. A finished game can be ported to different platforms by determining the packaging process with no change to the game's code . Unity utilises but is not limited to C# development which enables developers to code in a high level language which cuts the time and offers plenty native and powerful functions instead of having to create your own. The scripting in Unity is very easy to learn and become adept in, enabling a simple learning curve especially if you have a prior programming experience. Unity makes everything simple, including multiplayer and analytics which come as part of the engine and can easily be integrated into your project. Unity also boasts an impressive Assets market which offers art assets, code snippets, complete projects, audio, music and editor extensions. Combine all the above with a UI designer, animations suite, advanced audio options, physics, out of the box AI, high quality graphics and shading and you have one of the best tools of game development able to bring any idea to life and allow you plenty of flexibility to ensure that you are able to craft masterpieces whether you're a hobbyist or a pro. Unity is free to use, develop and publish on. However there is Unity Pro which comes with extra features and costs $75 per month subscription or $1500 one off payment. If you wish to develop and publish using Unity Pro for iOS or Android then you have to pay another $1500 for each of them or subscribe which costs you another $75 each.
