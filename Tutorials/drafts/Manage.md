# Manage

[toc]

The Manage section allows you to quickly create dynamic content management forms. You will be able to create new Sections ( Screens ), self contained Forms ( Snippets ) and custom Analytics Dashboards ( Charts ). Creating your own custom Forms allows you to manage your content in any shape or form, you will be able to expand on top of Built in GameSparks features, create management Sections dedicated and specialised to your requirements. Additionally the experts here at GameSparks are able to help setup these custom forms per your request.   The Management section is where you can build your own forms to manage your game based on your own rules. By building forms for your most regular tasks, it allows you to perform these without having to understand underlying data structures of the platform. It also allows you to build screens to manage your own mongo collections, this functionality is currently in beta. To get you started with building forms, we've imported some examples for managing players and leaderboards.

The sections that make up the Management page are:

  * Snapshots
  * Screenbuilder

Snapshots feature allows you to Create, Copy, Delete, Publish, Revert and Preview the configuration of your Game, allowing for in-depth management of each stage of the release. They're a good way to backup your configuration, in case a change in the configuration create problems in the future, making it very simple to roll back to a previous version of your game's configuration. For in-depth information about Snapshots, click [here](/tutorials/snapshots). The Screenbuilder allows you to build dynamic forms which are user-interface driven configuration for your game in-flight.
