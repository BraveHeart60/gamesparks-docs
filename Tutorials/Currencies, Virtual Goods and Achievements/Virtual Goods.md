# Virtual Goods

[toc]

In the context of the GameSparks platform, a Virtual Good is any in-game asset that can be awarded, accumulated or bought. This would cover XP points and in-game currencies as well as specific goods that deliver benefits in-game (convenience, customisation, competitive advantage etc).  These can be used and consumed cross-platform. You can set up Virtual Goods to be bought as IAPs - you associate the Virtual Goods with the Product IDs of the corresponding items on the stores and when a good is purchased we can reconcile the store receipts with the items.  You can also establish relationships between them so they can be traded or converted.

## Managing Virtual Goods configurations
