# How to access Leaderboards via Cloud Code

Imagine the scenarios where you want to determine the position of given player within a Leaderboard or that you want to get the player id of whoever is at a given position. You can implement these two features using the Cloud Code SparkRequests API, the API allows requests to be sent either as the current player or as any other player within your game.

To find the rank of a given player use a [LeaderboardDataRequest](/API Documentation/Request API/Leaderboards/LeaderboardDataRequest.md) which will return the data associated with the player:

```    
    var request = new SparkRequests.LeaderboardDataRequest();
    request.entryCount = 1;
    request.leaderboardShortCode = "leaderboardSC";

    var response = request.Send();
```

Now you'll have GameSparks response stored in your response variable as a JSON object.
