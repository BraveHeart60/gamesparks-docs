# Using Cloud Code

## Introduction

Using Cloud Code is an important part of the GameSparks Services. Cloud Code helps you create custom logic that can be used across different platforms. Cloud Code is platform independent and is written in JavaScript. When using Cloud Code, you can implement various Portal configurations into your game, these can be Leaderboards, Events, etc. This can be achieved using any of GameSparks provided SDKs. All of the GameSparks SDKs are interchangeable, meaning that if, for some reason, you wanted to use a different SDK, you wouldn't need to change the Cloud Code you've already written. In this tutorial you will learn how to persist some meaningful data in mongoDB using Cloud Code. In this tutorial you will be storing and retrieving X,Y and Z coordinates.

## Event Creation

Since you will be Setting data to and Getting data from the database, you should create two events using the Events Configurator. Simply navigate to the *Configurator* and click *Add New*. You will then be greeted by the Event Creation Form.

The first Event will be used to Set the Coordinates. For this tutorial, we have chosen* 'Set_Pos'* as our Short Code. After you've filled in the Name and the Description, you will need to add an *attribute* to your Event. This is a parameter necessary for the Event to be executed. We've used *'POS'* as the attribute Short Code, this is the value you'll be passing in via either an SDK or the Test Harness. Make this attribute a *JSON* because you will be passing in a few variables into the Event as a JSON object. You can also set a *Default Value*, which will be useful when running your tests.

After you finish making the Set Event, go ahead and make the Get Event. The Get Event does not need any *attributes* because no values will be passed in. We used* 'Get_Pos'* as the Short Code for this Event.


## Cloud Code

### Set Event

After creating the two Events, you can attach some *Cloud code* to them and prepare them for use. Navigate to the *Cloud code* tab which is under the *Configurator* menu a few item under our Events tab. Now you can write the Cloud Code that will handle the Position Setting. As seen in the image, all you need to do is *getData* that was sent with the Request, get the current player using *getPlayer* and finally set Players Script Data using *setScriptData*.


```
    var POSV = Spark.getData().POS;

    Spark.getPlayer().setScriptData("POSVAR", POSV);
```

### Get Event

The Get Position Event is essentially a reverse of the Set Position Event. Here we get the Player using *getPlayer*, then we retrieve the Script Data that was Set for this player using *getScriptData*. Finally we use *setScriptData* to Set the Position in the Response of the Event.


```
    var POS = Spark.getPlayer().getScriptData("POSVAR");

    Spark.setScriptData("POS", POS);
```

## Test Harness

![](img/UsingCloudCode/6.png)

Firstly, you will need to Register a new player. This can be achieved by using the [RegistrationRequest](/API Documentation/Request API/Authentication/RegistrationRequest.md). To do so, you will need to navigate to the Test Harness, select the RegistrationRequest, fill in the JSON details and hit play.

Now you'll want to Call the Set Position Event to set the X, Y and Z coordinates in the Players Script Data. To do so, go to the LogEvent and select your Event. Fill in the JSON details and hit play. Don't worry if your response contains no data, as none has been set. Note: If you had the Requests debugger ticked, it will open at this point. This only happens if the Request has some Cloud Code set on it. Either step through the code or stop debugging. You can read more about the debugger [here](/Documentation/Test Harness/Debugger.md).

You can now validate that the POS has been set in the players Script Data by Calling an [AccountDetailsRequest](/Getting Started/Using Cloud Code/README.md).

Finally you can Retrieve the data stored in the players Script Data by running the Get Position Event. This time you will see this in the Response as it was set using *Spark.setScriptData* in our Cloud Code.
